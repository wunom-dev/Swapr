Swapr: A Decentralized Token Swap Smart Contract on Stacks

Overview
**Swapr** is a **Clarity-based decentralized exchange (DEX)** smart contract that enables **peer-to-peer token swaps** directly on the **Stacks blockchain** without intermediaries.

This contract allows users to:
- **List** their tokens for swapping with custom price ratios.  
- **Execute** secure and trustless swaps between fungible tokens (SIP-010 compliant).  
- **Cancel** unfulfilled swaps safely.  
- **Verify** swap authenticity and balances on-chain through Clarityâ€™s predictable, auditable logic.

Key Features
- **Trustless swaps:** Users retain full control until execution.
- **SIP-010 compliant:** Works seamlessly with standard Stacks fungible tokens.
- **Transparent logic:** Every transaction is verifiable on-chain.
- **Modular design:** Can be extended for liquidity pools or automated pricing (AMM).
